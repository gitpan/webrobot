Requirements
============

- perl-5.6.1 or later. I don't know whether it runs on older perl versions.
  If you want to try it out you may uncomment
      require 5.006_001;
  in Makefile.PL

- a bunch of modules, see Makefile.PL

- Expat http://www.jclark.com/xml/expat.html and http://expat.sourceforge.net/
  You need to install expat *before* you install this module because
  XML::Parser requires OpenSSL.

- [optional] If you wish https support you must install OpenSSL
  http://www.openssl.org/ and Crypt::SSLeay
  You may install it later.

- [optional] If you wish to send e-mail install MIME::Lite.


Installation
============

It's all pure Perl, but you need a bunch of modules from CPAN.  The
easiest way to install this distribution is using the CPAN shell.

    perl -MCPAN -e shell
    install WWW::Webrobot

Of course you may use the traditional canon (after you installed all
required modules):
             
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

If you are on a windows box you should use 'nmake' rather than 'make'.


Installation on Windows

[TBD]
