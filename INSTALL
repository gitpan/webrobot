Requirements
============

- perl-5.8.0 or later. See INSTALL-561 if you insist installing it on Perl 5.6.1.

- a bunch of modules, see Makefile.PL

- Expat http://www.jclark.com/xml/expat.html and http://expat.sourceforge.net/
  You need to install expat *before* you install this module because
  XML::Parser requires Expat.

- [optional] If you wish https support you must install OpenSSL
  http://www.openssl.org/ and Crypt::SSLeay
  You may install it later. Follow the installation instructions in
  Crypt::SSLeay if your OS comes with OpenSSL installed, but you encounter
  problems (that is, install it again in in the preferred location).

- [optional] If you wish to send e-mail install MIME::Lite.


Installation
============

It's all pure Perl, but you need a bunch of modules from CPAN.  The
easiest way to install this distribution is using the CPAN shell.

    perl -MCPAN -e shell
    install WWW::Webrobot

Of course you may use the traditional canon (after you installed all
required modules, see Makefile.PL):
             
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install


Installation problems
=====================

I suggest the following order

- Install Perl
- Install expat http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/
- Install Webrobot via cpan shell
- [optional] Install MIME::Lite (for sending mails)
- [optional] Install OpenSSL (for usage by  Crypt::SSLeay)
- [optional] Install Crypt::SSLeay (for https support)

Although expat is installed in many operating systems it may be
in another destination as XML::Parser will expect it.
If you fail installing Webrobot then I suggest this order:

- install LWP
- install expat into the standard directories
- XML::Parser
- again install Webrobot via cpan shell


Installation on Windows
=======================

If you are on a windows box you probably should use 'nmake' rather than 'make'.
If you can't install perl yourself you may

- use the ActiveState distribution http://activestate.com/

- use the Perl version on http://webrobot.abas.de/download.html
  It contains all necessary modules, but doesn't contain webrobot itself.
  - Unpack it to c:/perl or anywhere else
  - set PATH to find perl (e.g. c:/perl/bin)
  - unpack webrobot*.tgz into <WEBROBOT>
  - set PERL5LIB=<WEBROBOT>/lib
