        NOTE: This version requires Perl 5.8.0 or later due to 'Encode'.
        This was necessary for Unicode and MIME support.
        See INSTALL.PERL-561 how to use it on Perl 5.6.1 (not recommended).

        Unicode and MIME types: this should now work correctly,
        tests are t/encode*.t, currently for iso-latin1 and utf-8.
        TESTS FOR OTHER LANGUAGES/MIME-TYPES ARE HIGHLY WELCOME.
        - HTTP response data are interpreted according its MIME type.
        - FIXED: testplan input (XML file) is now true utf-8
        - Parser HTML to XML: support for MIME types and utf-8

        Properties/variables
        - New properties from HTTP status line
        - Property assigned with random number
        - Display assigned properties in HTML and text output

        WWW::Webrobot::Print::Html
        - Display runtime-assigned properties
        - display of non-HTTP actions (e.g. SLEEP, COOKIES) improved

        WWW::Webrobot::Print::Test
        - More (better) output in case of 'Not ok'
        - Nicer output: Multibyte characters display \x{....}

        Others
        - Many new installation tests
        - Version info for 'webrobot' and 'webrobot-load', '-v'
        - Sending Mail: Attachments supported: You may redirect output to
          a file and mail this file.
        - FIXED: XML encoding (&entity;) in 'webrobot-gen-plan' produced
          invalid testplans.
        - FIXED: Some minor bugs, mostly display of text.

        - Sleep tag in test plans: <sleep value="5"/>
        - Dynamic properties are now also evaluated in assertions.
        - Fix docs
        - Tests improved

0.50 2004-09-14   (*) break old test plans or configuration files
        - Properties and configuration:
          * Syntax for properties is ${property} "instead" of "{property}"
          - Reading (dynamic) properties from file and from output of
            external scripts. There are now static properties (evaluated when
            test plan is read) from configuration file and dynamic properties
            (evaluated when test plan is run) read from a file or script.
          - Defining properties by means of a http response (also dynamic):
            New properties can be defined when a request was done.
            This include the returned header fields, regular expression
            and XPath to the response content.
          - Dynamic properties are now true variables and can be overwritten
          - System property "unique id ${_id} in test plans
            (most usefull for webrobot-load)
          - Allow use of recently defined names within the configuration:
                names=server=myhost 
                names=application=http://${server}/app
            In the last version these names worked within test plans only.

        - Referrer:
          - <referrer value='on'/> tag to enable referrers in HTTP requests
          - In the config file: "referrer_bug=1"
            to emulate a common browser bug when using referrers

        - Output (WWW::Webrobot::Print::*)
          - Show name/value pairs when using <config>
          - Show value of XPath expression in ::Html
          - ::Html: Better frame handling, some browser had been confused
          - ::Test: Better output

        - Test plan:
          - GET request: <data> section as in POST. The url will be rewritten in
            http://url?parm1=value1&parm2=value2
          - New assertion predicate: <string value="..."/>
          * <regex .../> in assertions had double "\" escapes, now normal regex.

        - Others:
          - httpd for tests during installation
          - more tests
          - API: WWW::Webrobot: Reading configuration and test plan from
            variables, (was file read only)
