Installation
============

For Installation and prerequisites see file INSTALL.


Support
=======

This software is considered alpha because

* Some interfaces may change.
* There are not enough tests that assure functionality.

Though - there seem to be no major stability problems.  I tested it on
Linux (perl 5.6.1 and 5.8.0) and Windows 2000 (perl 5.8.0 with LWP
patch).
