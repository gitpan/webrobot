Installation
============

For Installation and prerequisites see file INSTALL.


Support
=======

This software is considered alpha because some interfaces may change.

Though - there seem to be no major stability problems.  I tested it on
Linux (5.8.0) and Windows 2000 (perl 5.8.0 with LWP patch).

For further information visit http://webrobot.abas.de. This site contains

* screenshots
* tutorials
* A compiled Perl for Windows with all necessary modules included
