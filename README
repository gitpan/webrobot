Purpose
=======

WebRobot is a data driven http client heavily based on LWP.  It can be
used for

* automating http requests
* for a kind of web based unit tests
* for stress tests of web servers (limited).

For more information see lib/pod/README.pod and lib/pod/WebRobot.pm.
You may want to format it before:

    pod2text lib/pod/README.pod        > README.txt
    pod2text lib/WebRobot/WebRobot.pod > WebRobot.txt


Installation
============

For Installation and prerequisites see file INSTALL.


Support
=======

This software is considered alpha because

* Some interfaces may change.
* There are not enough tests that assure functionality.
* It's my first project uploaded on CPAN, so be patient an e-mail me problems.

Though - there seem to be no major stability problems.  I tested it on
Linux (perl 5.6.1 and 5.8.0) and Windows 2000 (perl 5.8.0 with LWP
patch).
