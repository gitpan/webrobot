TODO list for Perl module WWW::Webrobot

- setup a HTTP server for tests.
  LWP has one integrated, I think that one can be used or copied

- DTD for test plan

- use HTTP::Proxy as a filter instead of HttpSniffer.pl

- Load tests for windows: substitute
      open($HANDLE, "-|")
  in WWW/Webrobot/Forker.pm to make it work on windows

- short circuit evaluation in assertions

- check protocol ftp: I don't know whether it will work.
