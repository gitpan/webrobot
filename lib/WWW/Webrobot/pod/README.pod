WebRobot is a data driven http client heavily based on L<LWP>.
It can be used

=over

for automating http requests

=item *

for a kind of web based unit tests

=head1 How to use it

=over

=item *

You define your requests in an XML file,
possibly with additional information like a description or an assertion.
This is called to be a test plan.
See L<WWW::Webrobot::pod::Testplan>.

=item *

You configure WebRobot (proxies, authentification, ...)
with a simple properties file.
See L<WWW::Webrobot::pod::Config>.

=item *

You run L<webrobot> with your test plan and configuration file.

=item *

You inspect the output in text or html form depending on the output filters in use.
See L<WWW::Webrobot::pod::OutputListeners>.

Plans are parameter enabled (names).
