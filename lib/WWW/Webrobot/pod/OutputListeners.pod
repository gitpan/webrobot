=head1 NAME

WWW::Webrobot::pod::OutputListeners - Interface for the family of output listeners

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage within a config file:

 output=WWW::Webrobot::Print::MakeTestplan
 output=WWW::Webrobot::Print::Text
 output=WWW::Webrobot::Print::Test
 output=WWW::Webrobot::Print::Html
 output=WWW::Webrobot::Print::File 'dir' => 'diff_new', 'diff_mode' => 'diff_orig'
 output=WWW::Webrobot::Print::File 'dir' => 'diff_orig'

For writing your own class please study the source of
L<WWW::Webrobot::Print::Text> or L<WWW::Webrobot::Print::Test>.


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Output listeners are defined within a config file,
see L</SYNOPSIS> and L<WWW::Webrobot::pod::Config>.
They are called in sequence if you instantiate more than one listener.


=head1 METHODS

If you want to implement an output listener
you must implement the following methods:

=over

=item $obj -> global_start ()

This method is called once for a testplan before further processing is done.
You may use it to open files, etc.

=item $obj -> global_end ()

This method is called once for a testplan after all processing is done.
You may use it to close files, etc.

=item $obj -> item_pre ($arg)

This method is called before any request is done.
The argument is a hash that defines the values for this single request.
This hash is defined within the testplan, see L<WWW::Webrobot::pod::Testplan>.

=item $obj -> item_post($r, $arg)

This method is called after any request has completed.

B<$r> is a L<HTTP::Response> object.
It contains the both the request and the response.

There may be situations where your testplan request results in a
authentification or redirecting response
(got a 401 authenticate response or 3xx redirect response).

In this case Webrobot does the necessary follow up requests
as defined in L<LWP::UserAgent>.
You may access any chaining requests via the C<_previous> Attribute.

B<$arg> is the same as in C<item_pre>


=begin comment

=item $obj -> item_post_change ($r, $arg, $index)

[EXPERIMENTAL]
This method is only required in conjunction with L<Print::FilterHTTP>
for the use with HttpSniffer.pl.
It is not required for output filters within the config file.

This method is called if a request needs an update.
See  L<Print::FilterHTTP> for details.

B<$r> and B<$arg> are the same as in C<item_post>.
B<$index> is the index to be updated.

=end comment

=head1 IMPLEMENTING CLASSES

=over

=item L<WWW::Webrobot::Print::Text>

This listener produces output as plain text on STDOUT.

=item L<WWW::Webrobot::Print::Test>

This listener produces output for Test::Harness.

=item L<WWW::Webrobot::Print::Html>

This listener generates a bunch of HTML files to be viewed with a web browser.

=begin comment

This is the only one that supports C<item_post_change>.

=end comment

=item L<WWW::Webrobot::Print::File>

Write response content to the file system
and diff to a previous run

=item L<WWW::Webrobot::Print::MakeTestplan>

Write out all visited urls.
This is usefull
if you run WWW::Webrobot::Recur::LinkChecker or  WWW::Webrobot::Recur::Browser
where additional urls are visited.
The output format is suitable for L<webrobot-gen-plan>.
